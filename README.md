# Pom & Honey Ordering Site

This code is a project for CSCE-331 (Introduction to Software Engineering). This project is creating a website for Pom & Honey at the Memorial Student Center at Texas A&M University which will cater towards a customer, cashier and manager side. Customers are able to access the site, browse and place mobile orders and view their order status. On the cashier view, cashiers are able to create a new account and login, put in orders and check out customers, and view and update the status of currently placed mobile orders. A manager has all the functionalties of a cashier, as well as the ablitiy to update inventory and menu items, view performance reports, and access and update employee information. We also aim to provide extra accessiblity for users with language barriers by providing a translation functionalitiy via Google Translate. Furthermore, to provide extra security and assist in our users' experience we implemented in Google OAuth and Google Maps APIs.
